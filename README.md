# CSGPDC CTF

Hi, welcome to CSGPDC CTF. This CTF is different from the traditional CTF, where traditional focuses more on security aspects; this is flavored towards solving algorithm and data structure questions. In simpler terms, you have some flavor of CTF on solving leetcode questions.

You have 3 questions as part of this competition. Each question will be hidden in a quirky way, and clue will be given to find the question. You would first try finding the hidden question, and then once you have found the question, the question would compose of two things a problem statement similar to leetcode and then input case for the question. You are now required to solve the question and run the solution on the input given. Then once you have answer for the given input you will follow instruction given on how to construct the flag and submit the flag.

## Whats a Flag?
